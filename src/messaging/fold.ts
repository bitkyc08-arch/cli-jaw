// ─── Canonical Folding ───────────────────────────────
// Turns a string into the form its eventual reader would see — escapes
// decoded, invisible characters removed, compatibility characters folded —
// while remembering where every surviving character came from.
//
// The offset map is the point of this module. Finding a secret in the folded
// copy and then deleting that literal from the original fails twice over: an
// escape spliced INSIDE the secret means the literal is not there at all, and
// a run that legitimately appears elsewhere gets destroyed with it. Ranges
// carry a match back to exactly the bytes it came from.
//
// COORDINATE SYSTEM: UTF-16 code units, everywhere. Regex indices,
// String.length and slice offsets all speak code units, so the map must too.
// Walking a normalized character by code POINT desynchronized the map the
// moment NFKC produced an astral pair.

/**
 * Unicode characters that render as nothing. Splicing one into a token hides
 * it from a naive matcher while leaving the token usable — the character
 * disappears on copy, or is stripped by the next parser in the chain.
 *
 * Cc/Cf covers the format controls (zero-width space and joiners, word joiner,
 * soft hyphen, bidi marks, BOM) plus the C0/C1 control characters.
